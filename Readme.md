# The University of Helsinki [Full Stack Open 2022](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

A repository containing my submissions for The University of Helsinki Full Stack Open 2022 

This repository is organized by parts. Each folder corresponds to a respective part of the course.

I have included links to each part of the course on the website for anyone who may be curious about what was covered or interested in taking the course for themselves.
